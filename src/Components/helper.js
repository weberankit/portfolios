Email: codingank@gmail.com
What's new in my project? Lots of projects are available 🚀 I have built many projects; some solve real problems, and some are clones. 📄 The AIPDF project is one of my best projects as it solves a real issue. It is the first web project to provide all these features. 💡 In clone projects, I have added more features that are not present in the real projects. For example: 📺 In my YouTube project, I added dummy comment features like Reddit, where users can reply to each nested level comment. 🎬 In my Netflix clone project, I added PWA and multilingual features. 🌟 I believe in being innovative, which is my motto. I love to deep dive into concepts. Technical skill: ReactJS, JavaScript , PWA( progressive web app) , TailwindCSS, CSS, HTML, Git
