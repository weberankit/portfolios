🎯 But this one's different: ✌️

🚀 Big thanks to Akshay Saini 🚀 and the NamasteDev.com course. I've not only learned from the course but also 📢 🚀 added some cool new features. 🎓🙌🚀

Here's the Project Uniqueness:

🔵 Added a QR code, making it a breeze to open videos on your phone by scanning. 📱🔓

🔵 The most exciting part:

📣 Now, you can reply and comment on nested comments of any depth, thanks to our recursive filtering. 🧩🔁

✅ Some say DSA isn't that important, but trust me, it's been a challenge for me, a DSA newbie. 📚💪 It is important to know at least the basics. 

Difficulty :
Fail-😌
I initially added replies directly to comments without IDs, and it worked. But in the console, it only displayed the value, not in the DOM – possibly due to complex nested comments. React does not re-render it. I tried everything to make it happen, but it didn't. 😓🔍

Finally 😃
So, I switched to Redux and adopted the ID value approach for adding comments. 🔄💬

However, learning recursion took time, as I was not well-versed in it. After understanding it, I implemented 🚨 N-level recursive filtering 🚨 for adding replies to nested comments. 🧠🔄 (so that nested comments can be filtered and replies added to that particular comment, and also generated a unique ID for the reply comments for further comments)
And voilà, it's done! 🎉

detailinfo:` 'FoodWeb' : 🗼BEST FEATURES OF MY FOODY WEB APP🗼 
 🚀Location-wise rendering of restaurant lists (state-wise)🚀
 
🌈: It 📢renders restaurant lists on the basis of user location just by clicking the nearby button, and it will show restaurants in that city.

🌈: If the user denies his location, the default Delhi restaurants list is going to be displayed there.

🌈 If a Swiggiy-attached restaurant is not available at their location or is user-denied, then it will throw an alert msg and display the default one

🌈 It even works on the phone, which was earlier not possible(API ISSUE FIXED).
Before developing these features I 😦 thought it would not be possible to render the list on the basis of the location of the user from such very huge dynamic configuration data I have tried and it takes lots of time to do this but finally, it is done  😊 

Special Thanks to Akshay Saini 🚀 because of him we are able to think of and able to do such features.
 👉🏻 Link to the website in the comment section
 Note: I have checked this website in 3 different states with the help of my friends and it's working fine if you find any bugs then plz feel free to point them out as we are here to learn. 

must read this:-
🔴How do I render a list of data on the basis of user location?
 ✔️uses user location latitudes and longitudes by using JS and an API for 
 City names, After that, implemented this with the API of
 Swiggy and also filtered cards that have a restaurant list.
